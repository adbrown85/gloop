Gloop - Lightweight C++ wrapper for OpenGL

Gloop is a lightweight C++ wrapper for making OpenGL easier to write, read,
and maintain.  Rather than taking a new, high-level approach unfamiliar to
developers who are already familiar with OpenGL, Gloop is intended to be a
simple, straightforward wrapper on top of OpenGL.  Everything in Gloop
corresponds directly to an object or function in OpenGL.  Writing applications
with Gloop is just like writing applications in OpenGL, only easier.

Gloop has a number of advantages over straight OpenGL.  Most importantly,
it is object-oriented, so instead of passing identifiers to functions,
developers simply call methods on the objects themselves.  As a result, code
using Gloop is much more type-safe, and it's easier for developers to find
the functionality they need.  In addition, Gloop may perform some basic
error checking where appropriate, generally only for methods used in
initialization since making the checks may stall the OpenGL pipeline.  Note
that the core objects are stateless, storing only their ID, so developers can
rest assured nothing tricky or misleading is going on behind the scenes.

To install Gloop, see the INSTALL document.  For a rundown on the changes
between versions, see the NEWS document.  Lastly, if you want to experiment
with the code or contribute new features or fixes, please see the HACKING
document.
