Glycerin - Fuel for OpenGL applications

Glycerin is a set of utilities for making OpenGL easier to write, read, and
maintain.  Rather than taking a new, high-level approach unfamiliar to
developers who are already familiar with OpenGL, Glycerin is intended to be a
simple, straightforward wrapper on top of OpenGL.  Other than several small
extensions, everything in Glycerin corresponds directly to an object or
function in OpenGL.  Writing applications with Glycerin is just like writing
applications in OpenGL, only easier.

Glycerin has a number of advantages over straight OpenGL.  Most importantly,
it is object-oriented, so instead of passing identifiers to functions,
developers simply call methods on the objects themselves.  As a result, code
using Glycerin is much more type-safe, and it's easier for developers to find
the functionality they need.  In addition, Glycerin may perform some basic
error checking where appropriate, generally only for methods used in
initialization since making the checks may stall the OpenGL pipeline.  Note
that the core objects are stateless, storing only their ID, so developers can
rest assured nothing tricky or misleading is going on behind the scenes.

To install Glycerin, see the INSTALL document.  For a rundown on the changes
between versions, see the NEWS document.  Lastly, if you want to experiment
with the code or contribute new features or fixes, please see the HACKING
document.
